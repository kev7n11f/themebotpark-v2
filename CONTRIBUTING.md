# Contributing to ThemeBotPark-v2

Welcome to ThemeBotPark! üé¢  
We're thrilled you're here to help build a universe of bots with flair, purpose, and immersion. Whether you're a developer, designer, storyteller, or dreamer‚Äîyour contributions fuel the future of themed interaction.

## Guiding Principles

- **Modularity is Power**: Build small, scalable components that plug into any theme or bot persona.
- **Theme-First Thinking**: Every contribution should enhance the expressive richness of bot environments.
- **Creative Utility**: We value function _and_ form. Your code should be both elegant and purposeful.
- **Open Collaboration**: Respect different perspectives. Bots are characters, and we want a diverse cast.
- **Ethics Matter**: Be mindful with data usage, accessibility, and representation.
